# Printbuddy container entrypoint.
#
# Runs as root (the image leaves USER unset, so containers start as
# root by default), chowns /app/data and /app/logs to PUID:PGID, then
# drops to PUID:PGID via gosu and execs the application. This fixes the
# class of "Permission denied" errors that bit users when:
#
#   - a Docker named volume was first created with root ownership and
#     the container was running with `user: 1000:1000` (named volumes
#     created by the daemon take its ownership; Dockerfile chmod hacks
#     cover the parent path but not subdirs created at runtime).
#   - a bind-mount source path didn't exist on the host yet, so dockerd
#     created it as root before the container started, leaving it
#     unwritable by uid 1000 inside the container — see #1211 / #668
#     for the virtual_printer bind-mount case the shipped compose
#     template ships uncommented.
#
# If the container is started with an explicit `user:` directive
# (compose `user:` or `docker run --user`), the entrypoint runs as that
# user instead of root and chown isn't possible. The script falls
# through to direct exec without modifying ownership — preserving the
# previous behavior for users who pin a specific uid via compose.
