## Code of Conduct

Please read and follow our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) to keep our community welcoming and respectful.

## Before You Start

**Every contribution starts with an issue.** Before writing any code or opening a pull request:

1. **Open a new issue** or **comment on an existing one** describing what you'd like to work on
2. **Wait for agreement** — discuss the approach with a maintainer so we're aligned on scope and direction
3. **Get assigned** — once we agree, a maintainer will assign the issue to you
4. **Then start coding** — only open a PR for an issue that is assigned to you

**No assigned issue = no PR.** Pull requests without a corresponding assigned issue will be closed.

This keeps everyone on the same page, avoids wasted effort on changes that may not fit the project's direction, and prevents multiple contributors from working on the same thing.

## Documentation Requirements

Features and user-visible behavior changes **must** include matching documentation updates. Most docs live in this repository; if a separate docs or website repo is introduced later, link the matching companion PR from the code PR.

### When docs updates are required

| Change | Needs wiki? | Needs website? |
|---|---|---|
| New feature | ✅ | Maybe (if in the feature list) |
| New config key / setting | ✅ | ❌ |
| New port, URL, API endpoint | ✅ | ❌ |
| Installation or upgrade steps change | ✅ | ✅ |
| UI change that affects screenshots | ✅ | ❌ |
| Bug fix with no observable behavior change | ❌ | ❌ |
| Internal refactor | ❌ | ❌ |
| Test-only change | ❌ | ❌ |

### Workflow

1. Open your code PR here in `Printbuddy`
2. Include matching docs changes in the same PR when the docs live in this repository
3. If the change also affects a separate docs or website repository, open companion PR(s) there and **link them in the code PR description**
4. Merge the PRs together — usually code first, then docs, unless the docs reference new things that don't exist yet

If your change truly doesn't need docs (internal refactor, silent bug fix), say so in the PR description and give a one-line reason.

### Previews before you merge

Preview documentation locally before opening the PR. For repository markdown, review the rendered diff on GitHub. If a separate docs site is involved, run that site locally with its documented preview command before linking the companion PR.

Review like you would the production site. Catch broken links, layout regressions, typos, missing images. If it looks right, open the PR.

### Editing docs without a local clone

Documentation can be edited directly in the browser, no `git clone` required:

- **GitHub web editor** — click the pencil icon on any file in the repo
- **github.dev** — press `.` (period) on any repo page to open VS Code in your browser, with multi-file editing and syntax highlighting

## Getting Started

1. **Fork the repository** on GitHub
2. **Clone your fork** locally:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/Printbuddy.git
   cd Printbuddy
   ```
3. **Add the upstream remote**:
   ```bash
   git remote add upstream https://github.com/vmhomelab/Printbuddy.git
   ```

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.11+
- Node.js 20+
- npm

### Backend Setup

```bash
# Create virtual environment
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt  # Dev/test dependencies (pytest, ruff, bandit, etc.)

# Install pre-commit hooks
pip install pre-commit
pre-commit install

# Run backend
DEBUG=true uvicorn backend.app.main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

### Frontend Setup

```bash
cd frontend

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run development server
npm run dev
```

The frontend will be available at `http://localhost:5173` and will proxy API requests to the backend.

### Running with Docker

```bash
# Run the full application
docker compose up -d --build

# Run tests in Docker (mirrors CI)
docker compose -f docker-compose.test.yml run --rm backend-test
docker compose -f docker-compose.test.yml run --rm frontend-test
```

## Making Changes

1. **Create a branch** from `dev` for your changes:
   ```bash
   git checkout dev
   git pull upstream dev
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   # or
   git checkout -b fix/your-bug-fix
   ```

2. **Make your changes** following our code style guidelines

3. **Test your changes** thoroughly

4. **Commit your changes** with clear, descriptive messages:
   ```bash
   git commit -m "Add feature: description of what you added"
   ```

### Branch Naming

- `feature/` - New features
- `fix/` - Bug fixes
- `docs/` - Documentation changes
- `refactor/` - Code refactoring
- `test/` - Test additions or fixes

## Code Style

### Backend (Python)

We use [Ruff](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff) for linting and formatting. Configuration is in `pyproject.toml`.

```bash
# Check linting
ruff check backend/

# Auto-fix issues
ruff check --fix backend/

# Format code
ruff format backend/

# Check formatting without changes
ruff format --check backend/
```

### Frontend (TypeScript/React)

We use ESLint for linting and TypeScript for type checking:

```bash
cd frontend

# Lint
npm run lint

# Type check
npx tsc --noEmit
```

### Pre-commit Hooks

Pre-commit hooks run automatically on `git commit` and include Ruff linting/formatting, trailing whitespace fixes, YAML/JSON validation, and import shadowing checks. To run manually:

```bash
pre-commit run --all-files
```

## Internationalization (i18n)

The frontend uses [react-i18next](https://react.i18next.com/) for all user-facing text. **Never hardcode user-visible strings** — always use translation keys.

### Locale Files

Translations live in `frontend/src/i18n/locales/`:

| File | Language |
|------|----------|
| `en.ts` | English (primary) |
| `de.ts` | German |
| `fr.ts` | French |
| `ja.ts` | Japanese |
| `pt-BR.ts` | Brazilian Portuguese |
[...]
check for possibly more files!!!

### Adding New Strings

1. Add the key to the appropriate section in **all three** locale files
2. Use the `useTranslation` hook in your component:

```tsx
import { useTranslation } from 'react-i18next';

function MyComponent() {
  const { t } = useTranslation();
  return <span>{t('section.myNewKey')}</span>;
}
```

3. Keys are organized by feature (e.g., `spoolman.`, `nav.`, `common.`)

### Important Notes

- All three locale files must use the **same key structure** — same nesting, same key paths
- Always add keys to all three locales to maintain parity
- Run frontend tests after changes — locale parity is validated
- If you find structural inconsistencies between locales, fix them — different key paths cause silent fallback to English

## Authentication & Permissions

Printbuddy has an optional authentication system. When auth is enabled, API endpoints are protected by granular permissions.

### How It Works

Authentication is **opt-in** — when disabled, all endpoints are open. The system uses `RequirePermissionIfAuthEnabled` which:

- Checks if auth is enabled in settings
- If disabled: allows the request through (no-op)
- If enabled: validates JWT token/API key and checks the user has the required permission

### Adding Auth to New Endpoints

Use the `RequirePermissionIfAuthEnabled` dependency in your route:

```python
from backend.app.core.auth import RequirePermissionIfAuthEnabled
from backend.app.core.permissions import Permission

@router.get("/my-resource")
async def get_my_resource(
    _: User | None = RequirePermissionIfAuthEnabled(Permission.RESOURCE_READ),
):
    ...
```

### Permission Convention

Permissions follow the `resource:action` pattern (e.g., `filaments:read`, `printers:control`). Standard actions:

| Action | Usage |
|--------|-------|
| `read` | View/list resources |
| `create` | Create new resources |
| `update` | Modify existing resources |
| `delete` | Remove resources |

Some resources have additional actions (e.g., `printers:control` for start/stop, `printers:files` for file transfer).

### Adding New Permissions

1. Add the permission to the `Permission` enum in `backend/app/core/permissions.py`
2. Add it to the appropriate category in `PERMISSION_CATEGORIES`
3. Add it to the relevant default groups (`Administrators` gets all, `Operators` and `Viewers` as appropriate)
4. Use it in your route with `RequirePermissionIfAuthEnabled`

### Default Groups

| Group | Access Level |
|-------|-------------|
| **Administrators** | All permissions |
| **Operators** | Full control of printers, own items in archives/queue, read-only settings |
| **Viewers** | Read-only access to all resources |

## Testing

The easiest way to run tests is with the provided scripts in the project root:

```bash
./test_frontend.sh    # TypeScript check + ESLint + Vitest
./test_backend.sh     # Ruff lint/format + pytest (parallel)
./test_docker.sh      # Full Docker build, unit tests, and integration tests
./test_all.sh         # All of the above (frontend → backend → docker)
./test_security.sh    # Security scans (bandit, pip-audit, npm-audit)
```

`test_docker.sh` supports flags like `--backend-only`, `--skip-integration`, `--fresh` — run with `--help` for details.

`test_security.sh` runs fast scans by default. Use `--full` for the complete suite (CodeQL, Trivy, etc.) or specify individual scans like `./test_security.sh bandit codeql`.

### Running Tests Individually

**Backend** — tests are in `backend/tests/` with `unit/` and `integration/` subdirectories:

```bash
pytest backend/tests/ -v           # All tests
pytest backend/tests/unit/         # Unit tests only
pytest backend/tests/ --cov=backend  # With coverage
```

**Frontend** — tests use [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/) and are in `frontend/src/__tests__/`:

```bash
cd frontend
npm run test:run       # Single run
npm test               # Watch mode
npm run test:coverage  # With coverage
```

## CI Pipeline

Pull requests trigger automated CI checks via GitHub Actions (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`):

- **Backend**: Ruff lint + format check, unit/integration tests, pip-audit
- **Frontend**: ESLint, TypeScript type check, Vitest tests, production build
- **Docker**: Full image build, backend/frontend tests in Docker, integration health checks
- **Security**: CodeQL analysis, dependency audits

All checks must pass before merging. Run `./test_all.sh` locally before pushing to catch issues early.

## Submitting Changes

1. **Push your branch** to your fork:
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. **Create a Pull Request** on GitHub:
   - **Always target the `dev` branch** as the base branch (not `main`)
   - Use a clear, descriptive title
   - Fill out the PR template completely
   - Link any related issues
   - Include before/after screenshots for any visual changes

3. **Wait for review** - maintainers will review your PR and may request changes

### PR Guidelines

- Keep PRs focused and reasonably sized
- One feature or fix per PR
- Update documentation if needed
- Add tests for new functionality
- Ensure all tests pass
- Follow the existing code style
- **Visual changes require screenshots** — if your PR changes any frontend UI, include before/after screenshots showing the old and new appearance
