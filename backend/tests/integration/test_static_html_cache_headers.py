"""Tests for the SPA index.html cache-control behaviour.

Background: Vite emits content-hashed JS/CSS bundle filenames (e.g.
``index-JRaF_JhW.js``), so those assets are safe to cache forever — the
hash changes when their content changes. The wrapping HTML, however, is
the only file that knows which hash is current. Without explicit cache
directives, Chromium falls back to heuristic caching (typically 10% of
the time since Last-Modified) and on long-running kiosks happily serves
stale HTML across browser restarts. That stale HTML references an old
bundle hash, which is also still in disk cache, so the kiosk runs
pre-deploy JS indefinitely without ever knowing why.

Reproduced in the wild during the #1133 rollout — clients kept serving
the pre-fix picker for hours after every cache-clear attempt because
Chromium would re-seed its cache from
disk on next start. Fixed by sending ``no-cache, must-revalidate`` on
the two routes that serve ``index.html``.

These tests pin that behaviour so it can't silently regress (e.g. a
later PR adding a third index.html serve route forgetting the headers,
or someone tightening the policy to ``max-age=N`` and breaking deploys
in subtle ways).
