"""Integration test for the trace-ID middleware contract.

Tests focus on observable surface — what headers go out, what
ContextVar value the route handler sees — rather than re-testing the
ContextVar / filter primitives (those are covered in
``tests/unit/test_trace.py``).

A minimal FastAPI app is used instead of the production ``backend.app.main``
app: importing main.py would pull in the entire startup graph (DB
migrations, MQTT subscribers, scheduler, etc.) just to assert "the
middleware sets a header", and that overhead would dwarf the test value.
The middleware function is copied inline so the test pins the exact
contract expected of it.
