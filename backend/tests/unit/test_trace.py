"""Tests for ``backend.app.core.trace`` — the per-request trace ID
plumbing that ties uvicorn HTTP access lines to the application log
records produced while handling that request.

These tests stay at the unit level: the ContextVar / filter / inbound-
ID validator can each be exercised directly without spinning up a real
FastAPI app, and going through Starlette's TestClient just to assert
"the middleware sets a header" would obscure rather than illuminate the
contract.
