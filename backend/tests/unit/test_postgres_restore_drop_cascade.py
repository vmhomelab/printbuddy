"""Regression test for the Postgres restore drop-tables-with-CASCADE fix.

The bug: the restore path called `metadata.drop_all`, which only drops
tables defined in the SQLAlchemy ORM and emits plain `DROP TABLE` (no
CASCADE). When the live DB carries orphan tables from removed features
(e.g. legacy `spoolman_slot_assignments` whose `_printer_id_fkey`
constraint still references `printers`), Postgres refuses with
`DependentObjectsStillExistError` and the entire restore aborts before
any rows land.

The fix: drop every table in the `public` schema with `CASCADE` via a
`pg_tables`-iterating PL/pgSQL `DO` block, then re-create from the
ORM metadata. CASCADE removes external constraints alongside the table,
so orphan tables can no longer block the restore.

These tests guard against a regression to `metadata.drop_all` (which
would re-introduce the bug for any user with orphan tables).
