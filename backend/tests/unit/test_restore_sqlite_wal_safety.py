"""Regression tests for the SQLite WAL leftover bug in /settings/restore.

Background — see #1211 / #668. The live database runs in WAL mode
(``database.py:19``: ``PRAGMA journal_mode = WAL``). Anything written to
the database before the restore call that hasn't been checkpointed yet
sits in ``printbuddy.db-wal`` with valid checksums. The original restore
implementation used ``shutil.copy2(backup_db, db_path)`` which only
overwrites the main DB file's content, so on the next open SQLite found
the stale WAL and silently re-applied those page-level writes on top of
the restored DB — partially clobbering it with fresh-install state.

These tests exercise the bug condition deterministically (using the
classic reader-snapshot trick to prevent SQLite's close-time checkpoint)
and pin that the production restore path — the SQLite online backup API
called via ``src_conn.backup(dst_conn)`` — produces a clean restored DB
even with un-checkpointed WAL frames sitting on disk.

    The returned connection holds an open ``BEGIN`` transaction, which is
    what prevents SQLite from auto-checkpointing the WAL on the writer's
    close. In production this role is played by the route handler's own
    ``db: Depends(get_db)`` session — FastAPI's dependency injection keeps
    that session alive across the entire request, ``engine.dispose()``
