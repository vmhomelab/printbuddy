"""Tests for ``backend.app.core.logging_filters.WriteRequestsOnlyFilter``.

The filter is attached to uvicorn's ``access`` logger so we get an on-disk
record of state-changing HTTP requests in ``printbuddy.log`` (incident-triage
need: trace which endpoint fired a state change, e.g. ``stop_print``)
without churning the rotation window with the frontend's high-volume GET
status polls.

Tests use ``logging.LogRecord`` directly rather than spinning up a real
uvicorn server — the contract under test is purely "given this record, do
we keep it" and going through uvicorn would be a heavyweight integration
test for a one-line predicate.
