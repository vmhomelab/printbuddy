"""Regression test for the PrintLogEntry → PrintArchive backfill migration (#1390).

Reporter IndividualGhost1905 upgraded to 0.2.4.1 (which shipped the per-event
aggregation rewrite from #1378) and saw Quick Stats partially break on old
data:

  - Total Filament Cost = 0 (PrintLogEntry.cost was NULL on pre-upgrade rows)
  - Time Accuracy empty for pre-upgrade runs (the new query JOINs on
    archive_id, which the column-add migration left NULL)

#1378's migration added the columns but didn't backfill anything. This test
pins the backfill that the same `run_migrations` pass now performs:

  Step 1: link old log entries to their archive via print_name + printer_id.
  Step 2: copy archive.cost / energy_kwh / energy_cost onto the latest
          matching log entry per archive (so the sum across archives
          reproduces the pre-fix total exactly — pre-#1378, archive.cost
          held the LATEST run's value because reprints overwrote it).

Earlier reprints stay with cost = NULL — matching #1378's "first/latest run
writes, the rest stay NULL" convention for new prints, so reruns don't
double-count.
