"""Regression tests for ``PrinterManager._broadcast_status_change`` and
its wiring from ``set_awaiting_plate_clear`` (#1128).

The bug: ``awaiting_plate_clear`` is a Printbuddy-side flag, so toggling it
doesn't produce an MQTT push from the printer. Before the fix,
``set_awaiting_plate_clear()`` mutated state and persisted to DB but never
notified WebSocket subscribers. The plate-clear button on the printer card
disappeared "immediately" only because of an optimistic React Query cache
update on the click path; any other caller (admin script, second tab, an
automation that hits ``POST /printers/{id}/clear-plate``) silently left
the UI stale until the next coincidental status refresh.

These tests pin the contract: every flip of the flag must schedule a
``printer_status`` broadcast, and the broadcast must carry the new flag
value so subscribers see the right state without polling.
