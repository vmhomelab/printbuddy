"""Pydantic schemas for the unified slicer-presets endpoint.

The SliceModal pulls printer/process/filament options from three sources, in
priority order: cloud (the user's Bambu Cloud account), local (DB-backed
imported profiles), and standard (slicer-bundled stock profiles). The endpoint
returns all three lists with name-based dedup applied so each preset appears
exactly once across the response.

class UnifiedPreset(BaseModel):
    """A single printer/process/filament preset with its source.

    The ``id`` shape varies by source:
      - cloud  → Bambu Cloud setting_id (e.g. ``"PFUS9ac902733670a9"``)
      - local  → stringified DB row id from ``local_presets``
      - standard → preset name as written in the bundled JSON (the slicer
                   resolves bundled profiles by name during inheritance walk)

    The frontend treats ``id`` as opaque; the slice dispatch path uses
    ``(source, id)`` to fetch / pass the preset content to the sidecar.

    ``filament_type`` and ``filament_colour`` are populated for the filament
    slot only — they let the SliceModal pre-pick a preset per plate slot in
    the multi-color flow by matching against the source 3MF's per-slot type
    and color. Populated when the underlying preset JSON exposes them; left
    as ``None`` on bundled profiles where colour is a runtime spool attribute.

    ``compatible_printers`` is the slicer's own list of printer-preset names a
    process / filament preset declares itself valid for. Populated for the
    local tier (stored at import time); left ``None`` for cloud (no per-preset
    detail is fetched — rate limits) and standard (the sidecar's bundled
    listing doesn't expose it). The SliceModal uses it to filter the
    process / filament dropdowns by the selected printer (#1325); when it is
    ``None`` the modal falls back to the user's uploaded Slicer Bundles, which
    map each printer to the presets it ships.
