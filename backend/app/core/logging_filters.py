"""Logging filters for the Printbuddy log pipeline.

Holds two filters: ``WriteRequestsOnlyFilter`` keeps the file-side
uvicorn access log focused on state-changing HTTP methods, and
``CancelledPoolNoiseFilter`` drops SQLAlchemy connection-pool log noise
caused by Starlette's ``BaseHTTPMiddleware`` cancellation propagation
(see the filter's docstring for details). Both live here so tests can
import them without pulling in ``backend.app.main``'s startup graph.

    """Keep uvicorn access log records for state-changing HTTP methods only.

    Uvicorn's access logger emits one record per HTTP request, formatted as

        ``<client_addr> - "<METHOD> <path> HTTP/<ver>" <status>``

    On a typical Printbuddy install the bulk of that traffic is GETs — the
    frontend status-polling loop, the camera stream, snapshots, websocket
    upgrades. None of those can change server state on their own, so for
    incident triage ("who hit ``/print/stop`` at 09:23?") they're noise that
    just rotates the log file faster.

    This filter accepts only POST / PUT / PATCH / DELETE — the verbs that
    actually mutate state — and drops everything else. Match anchors on the
    surrounding ``" `` and trailing space so an unrelated literal substring
    in a URL (e.g. ``GET /api/posts/POST``) cannot false-match.

    Attach to ``logging.getLogger("uvicorn.access")`` (and only there — the
    pattern is uvicorn's specific format string and would silently drop
    everything if applied to a generic logger).

class CancelledPoolNoiseFilter(logging.Filter):
    """Drop SQLAlchemy connection-pool log records driven by request cancellation.

    Starlette's ``BaseHTTPMiddleware`` (used under the hood by FastAPI's
    ``@app.middleware("http")`` decorator) cancels the inner task scope when a
    client disconnects mid-request. The cancellation propagates into
    SQLAlchemy's connection-pool cleanup and surfaces as two distinct ERROR
    records — both expected on disconnect, neither actionable for the user:

    1. ``Exception terminating connection ... CancelledError`` — fires every
       time ``do_terminate`` is interrupted by the same cancel scope that's
       unwinding the request. The ``CancelledError`` traceback always
       attributes the cancel to ``BaseHTTPMiddleware.call_next``.

    2. ``The garbage collector is trying to clean up non-checked-in
       connection`` — fires later when the GC reclaims the session that
       couldn't return its connection to the pool because of (1). It's
       symptomatic of the cancellation, not a separate bug.

    These pile up under heavy upload load (long multipart uploads where the
    client times out before the server's response). Real connection-pool
    issues — pool exhaustion, broken connections from network hiccups, etc.
    — surface through DIFFERENT messages and a non-cancellation
    ``exc_info`` chain, so they keep flowing through this filter unchanged.
