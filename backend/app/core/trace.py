"""Per-request trace ID plumbing.

Each HTTP request gets a short hex ID set in a ``ContextVar``; downstream
log records (application *and* uvicorn access) read the same context and
include the ID in their output. The result is that one ``grep <trace_id>``
on ``printbuddy.log`` returns the access line + every line emitted on the
server side while that request was being handled — closing the loop
opened by piping uvicorn access into the file: the access line tells you
*who* called the endpoint, the trace ID tells you *what else happened*
on the server because of it.

Why a ContextVar instead of e.g. ``request.state``:

* asyncio copies the current context into every ``asyncio.create_task``,
  so background work spawned from within a request inherits the same
  trace ID without having to be passed it explicitly. ``request.state``
  doesn't survive that hop.
* The logging filter has no access to the FastAPI request object — it
  runs synchronously inside the stdlib logging machinery — and the
  ContextVar is the only mechanism that bridges async request scope to
  sync log emission.

Why no fancy structured-logging schema: this is a small project. The
existing log format is a single line per record; we add a single
bracketed token for the trace ID and stop there. If structured logging
is wanted later, it can layer on top — the ContextVar carries an opaque
string regardless of what consumes it downstream.
