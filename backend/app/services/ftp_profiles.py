"""Per-printer-model FTP tuning knobs.

Mirrors the shape of :mod:`backend.app.services.camera_profiles` — a
small registry of per-model overrides so quirky firmwares can be
tuned without sprinkling ``if model == "X":`` branches through
``bambu_ftp.py``. Adding a new model's quirk is a config edit (an
entry in ``_PROFILES`` plus the alias for its internal SSDP code if
needed), not another hard-coded branch.

The default profile matches the historical pre-fix behaviour, so
every model that doesn't have an entry here keeps its existing FTP
behaviour byte-for-byte.

Currently only the TLS-version cap lives here (P2S firmware
01.02.00.00 needs it — see ``cap_tls_v1_2`` below). The A1
data-channel-plaintext quirk still lives in :class:`BambuFTPClient`
via ``A1_MODELS`` / ``skip_session_reuse``; folding that into a
profile field is a future cleanup, not load-bearing for this fix.

    # default. Some Bambu printer firmwares (P2S 01.02.00.00 confirmed
    # by @iitazz, #1401) implement session reuse on the FTPS data
    # channel against an old vsFTPd build that doesn't tolerate TLS
    # 1.3's asynchronous session-ticket model: the data channel gets
    # torn down mid-stream and the upload aborts with 426 "Failure
    # reading network stream" — visible as a clean truncation at a
    # chunk boundary (one reporter saw exactly 7 × 64 KB landed on
    # the printer). Capping to TLS 1.2 makes session resumption
    # synchronous and the upload completes normally.
