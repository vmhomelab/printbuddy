"""Per-printer-model camera tuning knobs.

Printbuddy talks to multiple Bambu Lab printer models that all expose a
camera but in subtly different ways:

- **Chamber image** (port 6000, proprietary binary protocol) — A1, A1
  Mini, P1P, P1S. Frame pacing and TLS quirks are firmware-driven and
  don't go through ffmpeg.
- **RTSPS** (port 322) — X1 series, X2D, H2 series, P2S. Wrapped by a
  local TLS proxy + ffmpeg to MJPEG.

The RTSPS path used to live with hard-coded module constants in
``camera.py``: a single ``-probesize 32 -analyzeduration 0`` tuned for
X1/H2 fast startup. That breaks the P2S on firmware 01.02.00.00, whose
RTSP keyframe pacing is slow enough that ffmpeg can't lock onto the
stream within 32 bytes and gives up with "not enough frames to estimate
rate" (#1395 follow-up — Tschipel's reproduction).

This module replaces those module constants with per-model
:class:`CameraProfile` entries. Defaults match the historical pre-fix
behaviour, so existing models (X1, H2, X2D, X1E) keep their fast-
startup tuning unchanged. Quirky models override the relevant fields
only — the P2S entry below is the first example.

Adding a new model's quirk is a config edit (an entry in ``_PROFILES``
plus the alias for its internal SSDP code if needed), not another
hard-coded global constant.
