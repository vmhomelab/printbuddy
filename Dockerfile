# .git metadata the build context lets through (see .dockerignore); it
# contains `ref: refs/heads/<branch>`, which the SpoolBuddy remote-update
# flow reads at runtime via detect_current_branch() in spoolbuddy_ssh.py.
# Without this, the production image has no git metadata at all and would
# always pull `main` on the remote device regardless of which branch
# Printbuddy itself was built from.

# Without this COPY the routes return a bare 404 at request time and the 3D
# Preview iframe shows {"detail":"Not Found"} (see #1218). The directory is
# vendored third-party JS — the Vite build does NOT stage it into static/,
# the dev server serves it via a configureServer middleware that's dev-only.

# Create data directories. Ownership is normalised at startup by the
# entrypoint (chowns to PUID:PGID and drops privileges via gosu before
# exec'ing the app), so we don't need a chmod 777 hack here — that was
# the workaround for the previous compose `user: "1000:1000"` model and
# only worked when the volume's perms happened to survive (named volume
# first-create case; bind-mount-source case bit users in #1211 / #668).
#
# The sentinel file is needed so a freshly-created Docker named volume
# isn't "empty" from Docker's POV. On empty volumes Docker resyncs the
# directory metadata (incl. ownership) from the image on every mount,
# which would mean our entrypoint chown gets reverted on every restart
# and re-fired on every start (slow on multi-GB archive dirs). With a
# sentinel inside the volume on first mount, Docker considers the
# volume populated and stops resyncing, so the chown is genuinely
# one-shot.

# to fall back to a per-restart temp dir (paying the font-scan cost on

# silences the warning and keeps the cache alive for the container's
# lifetime. /tmp is writable by any uid, so this works regardless of PUID.
